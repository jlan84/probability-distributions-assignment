# Probability Distributions

This assigment will get you practice working with random quantities and their distributions.

In part I you will get some pracitice identifying which common distribution serves a good model for a given situation, and then using that distribution to calculate the probability of an event of interest.

In part II you will setup and run a simulation to draw samples from a distribution that is a complex combination of other random quantities.
